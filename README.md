# Plasimo-display-assistant
C++  Final Year Project in Undergraduate

## Introduction
[Plasimo](https://plasimo.phys.tue.nl/) is a toolbox that provides support for the numerical simulation of plasma sources of various degrees of equilibrium. It comes with a number of electromagnetic modules, flow solvers, modules for calculating transport coefficients, radiation transport and for the generation of ortho-curvilinear coordinate systems. PLASIMO supports transient and steady-state simulations of plasma sources in one-, two and three-dimensional geometries.

[Plasimo Display Assistant](https://github.com/Trouble404/Plasimo-display-assistant/tree/master/Plasimo%20Display%20Assistant) is a c++ based user-friendly interface to check the changing processing of [Plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics))

## Steps and tools
* Prototype design by [Mockplus](https://www.mockplus.cn/)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) are used to render the image
* [MFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library) used to build the dialogs in this software
* [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.kunal-chowdhury.com/2015/07/download-visualstudio-2015.html#5dp0esgEMVEyXOhd.97) used to write the function in each dialogs
